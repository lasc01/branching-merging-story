Once upon a time in the city of Lagos, there was a man always terrorizing the neighbourhood with his wealth. 
He was so rich thathe could even control the governor of the state
He was so influential that he handpicked every governor the state elected after his tenure.
He has sdecided to run for the president of the country
Claiming that it is his turn
There has been a controversy in his age. He claims to be 70 years old, although, everyone knows he is only lying.
Some people claim that he is actually 84 years old.
Ther has been controversies concerning his health recently
With him always being represented by his running mate during campaign and other activities.
We hope he realises that being a president of a country shouldn't be a do or die affair.
